# index.html
This is the main HTML file for your frontend, containing a React application rendered via ReactDOM.createRoot. It includes:
External script imports (React, Socket.IO, QRCode, Tailwind CSS, etc.).
Inline JavaScript (using Babel for JSX) defining the React components (AdminPage, LinkPage, RatingPage, App).
Socket.IO client-side logic for real-time communication.
This file is self-contained and doesn't rely on app.js or other frontend source files like those typically found in a Vite project. It seems to be the compiled or standalone frontend entry point.
Relevance: Critical for the frontend. This is likely the file served by your backend's static file middleware.
server.js
This is the Node.js backend server using Express and Socket.IO, connected to MongoDB Atlas for session storage.
It handles:
Socket.IO events (createSession, joinSession, startTimer, submitRatings, etc.).
Serving static files (assumed to be from a frontend folder, likely including index.html).
MongoDB interactions for session management.
Relevance: Critical for the backend. This is the main server file that handles API and real-time functionality.
app.js
This appears to be a React frontend entry point using react-router-dom for client-side routing, defining routes for CreateSession, JoinSession, and Game components.
However, it is not used in index.html. The index.html file contains its own React application logic inline, with components like AdminPage, LinkPage, and RatingPage, and uses hash-based routing (window.location.hash) instead of react-router-dom.
This suggests app.js might be part of a different or earlier version of the frontend, or an alternative implementation that uses a Vite-based build process.
Relevance: Likely not needed for your current application, as index.html is self-contained and doesn't reference app.js or the components/routers defined in it.
vite.config.js
This is a configuration file for Vite, a frontend build tool, specifying:
The React plugin (@vitejs/plugin-react).
The build output directory (../backend/public).
This implies a Vite-based frontend project structure, where the frontend is built and output to the backend's public folder for serving.
However, index.html doesn't appear to be a Vite-built artifact (it has inline scripts and no references to Vite-generated assets like /src or /dist). This suggests index.html might be a standalone file or from a different setup.
Relevance: Not needed if you're deploying index.html as-is, since it doesn't rely on a Vite build process. It would be needed if you were deploying a Vite-based frontend (e.g., with app.js and other source files).
package.json
Defines the frontend project's dependencies and scripts:
Dependencies: axios, react, react-dom, react-router-dom, socket.io-client.
Dev dependencies: vite, @vitejs/plugin-react.
Scripts: dev, build, preview for Vite.
This is typically used for a Vite-based frontend project, which would build the frontend into a dist or public folder.
Relevance: Not needed for the frontend if you're deploying index.html directly, as it contains all necessary scripts inline. However, it may be relevant for the backend's package.json (not provided) to define server.js dependencies.
package-lock.json
Locks the versions of dependencies listed in package.json.
Relevance: Same as package.json. Not needed if index.html is standalone, but required if you need to install dependencies for a Vite-based frontend or backend.
